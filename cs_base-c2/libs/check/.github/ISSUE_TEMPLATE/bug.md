# Bug Report
Thank you for filing a bug report! The more information you
can give us about your development environment, toolchain,
actions leading up to the bug, or any other contextual
information, the faster we'll be able to verify and diagnose
what went wrong.

At a minimun, please be sure to include the library version
you were working with. If you were trying to compile it from
source, please be sure to specify the compiler, compiler
version, operating system, operating system version, the
build system you used to generate the project, and whether
you were building from a source distribution or from version
control.

If you have no idea what any or all of the above terms mean,
you are always welcome to submit a bug report anyways, but
please remember the Fundamental Theorem of Bug Report
Submissions:

 > The amount of information in a bug report is directly
 proportional to its resolution speed.
